PIE Commands

1. open terminal
2. in terminal, pull PIE from github:
	git clone https://github.com/putonti/PIE.git

3. move to PIE directory
	cd PIE


4. move your paired-end or single fastq files, as well as the phage reference file, to the inputFiles folder

5. build PIE
	sudo docker build --tag pie:latest PIE

6. run PIE
	sudo docker run -v ~/local_machine_docker_folder:/pieOutputFolderName -i -t pie
(The folder pieOutputFolderName is specified by the user. This is the folder name to be used later when invoking PIE.)

7. you are ready to use PIE. Type python3 runPIE.py -h to see command line options, e.g.
	-o : Directory to store resulting files and name of sample as file prefix (required)
	-s : Name of sample for output file labels (required)
	-t : Number of processors to use (default=4)
	-n : Threshold for phage coverages (default=0.99)
	-f : Reference file of phage sequences (required)
	--version

	Single or Paired-End Read Inputs:
	-i : Single read file
	-p : Paired-end read files. List both read files with a space between

   example:
	python3 runPIE.py -f inputFiles/phage_reference_file.fasta -p inputFiles/R1.fastq inputFiles/R2.fastq -s sample_name -o pieOutputFolderName/sample_output
